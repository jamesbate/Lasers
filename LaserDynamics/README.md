# Laser Dynamics 

In this Folder, I will upload different pieces of software which model the dynamics of simple 
laser systems i.e. Q pulses, modelocking etc. These simulations to not account for the spatial 
varaitions, for which a full blown grid simulation would be required. Rather, the outputs are 
all only dependent on time.
