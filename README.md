# Lasers

This repository contains several small programs I am developping to help me when learning about 
Optics and Lasers in my Oxford Masters course. They are all concerned with implementing certain 
methods for solving optical system, such as the Angular Spectrum Method or Ray Matrices, or 
modelling with response of laser systems.
